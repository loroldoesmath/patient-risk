# Final Project: Data Analysis with Python

## Project Overview
This is a sample final project created for TEDA 1031 - Data Science with Python. Recall that the guiding question for this project is: *"How can I use Python to gain insight into a dataset?"* Feel free to use this README as a guiding template for your own project.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Brain Stroke Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jillanisofttech/brain-stroke-dataset)
- **Dataset Description**: This dataset contains demographic data on 4982 patients, in addition to uninvasive medical statistics and whether or not they've had a stroke.
- **Motivating Questions**: Can we predict which patients are more at risk of a stroke based on their demographic data? Is there a correlation between smoking, BMI, average glucose level, and stroke risk? 

## Data Cleaning
- Missing or duplicate values: 
- Outlier detection: 
- Data consistency

*Note: Refer to code comments for specific loading & cleaning operations.*

## Data Manipulation
- **Sorting**: Describe the sorting operations used, if any.
- **Filtering**: Explain any conditions applied to subset the data.
- **Grouping**: Mention the variables used for grouping and the purpose of this operation.
- **Merging**: If multiple datasets were merged, provide details about the merge process.
- **Reshaping**: Specify any reshaping done (e.g., pivoting or melting).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summarize the initial exploration of the dataset, including:
- Key findings or patterns identified in the data
- Descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, mode, standard deviation)
- Correlation insights or distribution analysis

## Statistical Analysis
This section details any statistical analyses performed on the dataset, including:
- Descriptive statistics (e.g., measures of central tendency and variability)
- Correlation analysis
- Distribution analysis

## Conclusions


## How to Run the Code
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/final-project.git
   cd final-project
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:  
   Make sure to install all necessary packages. Run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Analysis Script**:  
   Execute the main Python script to reproduce the analysis:
   ```bash
   python analysis.py
   ```
